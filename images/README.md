# Add Your Photos Here

## How to add your photos to the website

1. **Save your photos** into this `images` folder.

2. **Recommended filenames:**
   - `profile.jpg` — Main profile photo (hero section, about page)
   - `about.jpg` — Photo for the About page (optional, can use profile.jpg)
   - `transformation.jpg` — Photo for transformation section (optional)

3. **Supported formats:** `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`

4. **Recommended sizes:**
   - Profile: at least 400×400px (square works best)
   - About: 400×500px or similar

5. **After adding photos**, tell me the filenames and I'll update the HTML to use them.
